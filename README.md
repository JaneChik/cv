## My pagedown rendered CV

This is a repository with the code I use to create my CV. It is made with modified code of [Nick Strayer's datadrivencv package](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv) using R package [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).

The pdf version of CV can be found [here](link).
