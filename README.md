## My pagedown rendered CV

This is a repository with the code I use to create my CV. It is made with modified code of [Nick Strayer's datadrivencv package](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv) using R package [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).

The pdf version of CV can be found here on github ([short](https://github.com/JaneChik/cv/blob/master/chikina_cv.pdf) and [long](https://github.com/JaneChik/cv/blob/master/chikina_cv_full.pdf) versions) or [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11J6q1Qji4Ab4Z6LnwtBZl5XUZ-p3zPMS?usp=sharing).
